# ai_object_core_js

This is intended to be used for my aifinterface framework. However, 
This could be used for any simple javascript coding where you want to 
establish class like object that you want to have inheritance model. 


There are three core objects. 
AObject : that allows inheritance and extention 
Util    : Utility files that would be useful for any javascript 
Log     : logger that wraps console. 


It could be used as npm module ( require / import ) structure, however, 
it register itsself as a global with a name space ( com.ai ). So it could be used 
just loading this file.
